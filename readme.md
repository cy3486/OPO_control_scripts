## the device used in this repo
* spectrometer: Highfinesse LSA2R
* power meter head: Thorlabs PM100D
* rotary stage: Thorlabs PDR1C/M
* stage controller: Thorlabs PDXC2

## reminder
* the spectrometer software "LSA2R" is required to be running before running the code, other Highfinesse products may also works, but not tested. 
* the power meter(Thorlabs Optical power meter) and the stage controller (Thorlabs Kinesis) may NOT required, the codes are cited from [Thorlabs/Motion_Control_Examples](https://github.com/Thorlabs/Motion_Control_Examples/tree/main/Python/Benchtop/PDXC2) and [Thorlabs/Light_Analysis_Examples](https://github.com/Thorlabs/Light_Analysis_Examples/tree/main/Python/Thorlabs%20PMxxx%20Power%20Meters/TLPMX_dll)
* it doesn't matter if PM100D returns some nan power values, the code will be normal after some times, it is a bug, but I don't know how to fix it
* pip install pythonnet, NEVER pip install clr (used in the stage controller code).
